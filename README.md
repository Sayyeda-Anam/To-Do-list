# debugdeployment_project_To-Do-list
A to-do list application allows you to manage your tasks. You can add tasks, check them off as completed, and delete them.
1.Add tasks: You can enter new tasks and the application stores them in a list.
2.Check tasks:Once you've completed a task, you can mark it as checked, often by ticking a box or changing its font style.
3.Delete tasks: If a task is no longer relevant, you can remove it from the list entirely.
This functionality helps you stay organized and track your progress.
